Welcome Daphne, our new Head of Strategic Partnerships, and Balaji, joining as Strategic Advisor at Electric Minds!

Our non-profit AI initiative is growing, fueled by professionals who, despite busy day jobs, are passionate about making a real difference.

Climate change, healthcare, education – the world's biggest challenges are too complex for any one person or company to solve alone. Some people say AI can work miracles. We need to find out if that’s true, but one thing I know for sure: it will only work if we build ecosystems that bring together diverse minds and resources.

Want to be part of this collaborative effort? Check out our event calendar and join us in person if you can. Let's turn big ideas into impactful actions!

How can your company benefit from AI? Well, it depends – what kind of company are we talking about, and what are your ways of working?

Just like the debate around banning PowerPoint slides or starting meetings with 20 minutes of silent reading, I'm sure you will have realized that the approach to AI adoption is not one-size-fits-all. It really depends on your organization's culture, structure, and readiness for change – or maybe even you have different departments with their unique subcultures and varying levels of AI readiness.

I've always been fascinated by the Laloux Culture Model, it could be a key piece in the framework for understanding AI adoption. Amber orgs might be slow but steady, Orange ones are innovation machines but we have to remind them not to forget the human element, Green folks are all about people power but could struggle with the bottom line.

And if you're a Teal company, you can change the world. With self-directed teams and crystal-clear sense of purpose. Electric Minds is a great example, where we leverage this adaptive, purpose-driven approach to make AI accessible to all, bringing together diverse expertise through collaborative innovation across corporates, startups, education and government organizations to solve some of the big challenges we face as a global society today.

With this, I'm so excited to share with you that Manisha Sadhwani Judy Wong Brendon Clark Tina Zou Chantelle Tan have joined us to take the initiative to the next level! Get in touch with me if you'd like to know more!

Welcome Rex to Electric Minds where he will look at AI policies, ethical considerations, and inclusivity practices. With his impressive background in digital transformation and cross-functional collaboration, Rex is a perfect addition to our mission.

At Electric Minds, we're all busy professionals driven by a shared passion for using AI for good. Our team members, like Rex, have busy day jobs but generously contribute their time and expertise to make a real impact. While we love bringing people together through events, our work goes beyond that. We actively engage in meaningful projects that require collaboration across organizational boundaries. By breaking down silos, we can effectively address complex challenges and drive innovation in the field of AI that benefit all of humanity. I know these are big words, but we have to start somewhere.

Speaking of events, don't miss out on Katong AI Night on September 24th! Tickets are going fast, so grab yours now to join the conversation and connect with like-minded individuals. Daphne Balaji Judy Tina Manisha

A few years ago, I realized that my mother, who is in her 70s, is a meetup organizer, and she's been doing that for years.

Of course, she doesn't use that term. Or the Meetup app. Or any app, for that matter. Once a month, she and her friend bring the ladies in town together and run with a specific topic over breakfast. So it's about working with venues, food, finding speakers, and so on.

They've stopped advertising the event series because they have a loyal fan base that brings in new people through word of mouth, and their gatherings are always packed. At Electric Minds, we may run meetups in busy Singapore instead of rural Germany, but the idea is the same: building a community to create something remarkable. If you do it right and give people a unique experience, they will continue to come, and you may not even need free pizza and swag.

So many people are looking for the next challenge. Can we enable them to use AI and work on something that has real impact on society while advancing their careers?

If we're being honest, AI, with all its mind-blowing capabilities and promises, might also be one of the reasons we're starting to see disruptive changes in the global job market. But it's here now, and we can't uninvent it.

Here is an idea we are discussing at [Electric Minds](https://www.linkedin.com/company/electric-minds/): can we think of a setup where AI helps solve real issues, people learn by doing (instead of just taking course), and everyone benefits?

Obviously, this "solution" cannot be just another app, and even though money rules the world, the motivation must be impact. This is going to take collaboration – governments, businesses, education. Can it be done?

We don't have all the answers, and that's why it's so important to get together across industries to talk about this, build partnerships, and start to make things happen. Let's create targeted initiatives that apply these ideas!
